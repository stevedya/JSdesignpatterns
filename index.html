                    <h2> What are patterns</h2>
                    <p>Patterns are tried and tested reusable techniques that assist in solving common programming
                        problems.
                        The patterns are rigorously tested and analyzed by developers to ensure they are a trusted
                        solution.
                        They must, at a minimum, meet these three requirements: fitness of purpose, usefulness and
                        applicability to be considered valid (Addy Osmani, 2017). Although patterns are not
                        one-size-fits-all, they help create efficient and reliable solutions based on proven
                        techniques. </p>
                    <h2>Design patterns in JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>Design patterns are utilized everyday in JavaScript and JavaScript libraries. You may not have
                        realized it but many programming languages, including JavaScript and jQuery, have design
                        patterns
                        already built-in. We use patterns in DOM selectors, even though
                        document.getElementByClassname(“.item”) is more efficient in the browser, we still lean heavier
                        towards the jQuery library where we can select the same item by writing $(“.item”). Design
                        patterns
                        in JavaScript are typically used in large-scale applications but can assist programs of any size
                        in
                        solving common issues and creating readable, reliable and maintainable code.</p>
                    <h2>The history and importance of design patterns</h2>
                    <p>Design patterns in programming have been used since the creation of the programming industry. The
                        techniques were based on the work of architect Christopher Alexander and became widely known and
                        accepted after a now iconic publication about design patterns for software engineering in 1995.
                        Design patterns are important because they can be used on recurring problems in application
                        development making the program more efficient. They are also important because they bring
                        “method to
                        the madness”. Design Patterns are trusted, reliable solutions that also assist in creating
                        meaningful conversations between developers.</p>

                            <h3>What it is used for</h3>
                            <p>The constructor pattern is used to create unique type of objects with certain traits. It
                                prepares the object for use allowing to pass arguments where the constructor can set the
                                values of the properties and methods to make a new object.
                                “When we call a JavaScript constructor to create an object, all the properties of the
                                constructor's prototype are then made available to the new object. In this fashion,
                                multiple Car objects can be created which access the same prototype. “ (Addy Osmani,
                                2017)
                            </p>
                            <h3>Problems it solves</h3>
                            <p>The Constructor pattern allows us to construct a class-like object in JavaScript which is
                                a classless language.</p>

                                        <li>“Classes” in JavaScript</li>
                                        <li>Highly efficient when all properties are known</li>

                                        <li>Makes applications more efficient and structured</li>
                                        <li>Widely known pattern makes it easy for other developers to understand</li>
                                        <li>Constructor can make multiple objects rather than one with an object literal
                                        </li>
                                        <li> The prototype can be shared in a public method, but the constructed object
                                            will
                                            have closure (Sam Selikoff, 2013)
                                        </li>

                                        <li>If the new keyword is not used or forgotten variables will be created in the
