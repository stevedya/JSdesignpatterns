                <h2> What are patterns</h2>
                <p>Patterns are tried and tested reusable techniques that assist in solving common programming problems.
                    The patterns are rigorously tested and analyzed by developers to ensure they are a trusted solution.
                    They must, at a minimum, meet these three requirements: fitness of purpose, usefulness and
                    applicability to be considered valid (Addy Osmani, 2017). Although patterns are not
                    one-size-fits-all, they help create efficient and reliable solutions based on proven
                    techniques. </p>
                <h2>Design patterns in JavaScript</h2>
                <p>Design patterns are utilized everyday in JavaScript and JavaScript libraries. You may not have
                    realized it but many programming languages, including JavaScript and jQuery, have design patterns
                    already built-in. We use patterns in DOM selectors, even though
                    document.getElementByClassname(“.item”) is more efficient in the browser, we still lean heavier
                    towards the jQuery library where we can select the same item by writing $(“.item”). Design patterns
                    in JavaScript are typically used in large-scale applications but can assist programs of any size in
                    solving common issues and creating readable, reliable and maintainable code.</p>
                <h2>The history and importance of design patterns</h2>
                <p>Design patterns in programming have been used since the creation of the programming industry. The
                    techniques were based on the work of architect Christopher Alexander and became widely known and
                    accepted after a now iconic publication about design patterns for software engineering in 1995.
                    Design patterns are important because they can be used on recurring problems in application
                    development making the program more efficient. They are also important because they bring “method to
                    the madness”. Design Patterns are trusted, reliable solutions that also assist in creating
                    meaningful conversations between developers.</p>
